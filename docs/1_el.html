<p>At SFUSD, more than half of our students live in households with a
home language other than English, which include English Learner students
(ELs), Re-designated Fluent English Proficient students (RFEPs), and
Initial Fluent English Proficient students (IFEPs). In contrast, English
or American Sign Language Only students (EOs) are less than half.</p>
<p>As of 2024-03-18<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, there are a total of 12483 ELs actively
enrolled in SFUSD, making up to 24.8% of the student population<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Below is a breakdown of the proportions of four major English
Language Acquisition Status (ELAS) at SFUSD:</p>
<p><img src="1_el_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>The following five plots provide a closer look at the up-to-date
student enrollment by ELAS at each school. Each plot shows schools in
each of the five cohorts: high schools, middle schools, elementary
schools, early elementary schools, and K-8 schools.</p>
<p>Simply hove over a specific proportion of the colored bar of a
specific school to find out the number of students in detail.</p>
<p>Note that in each plot, every bar consists of four proportions of
ELAS within each school and the bars are ordered by the proportion of
ELs from the highest to the lowest.</p>
