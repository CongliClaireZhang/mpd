<p>At SFUSD, more than half of our students live in households with a
home language other than English. These students include English Learner
students (ELs), Re-designated Fluent English Proficient students
(RFEPs), and Initial Fluent English Proficient students (IFEPs)<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. In
contrast, English or American Sign Language Only students (EOs) are less
than half.</p>
<p>As of 2024-05-13<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, there are a total of 12593 ELs actively
enrolled in SFUSD, making up to 24.58% of the student population<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Below is
a breakdown of the proportions of four major English Language
Acquisition Status, or ELAS: EL, RFEP, IFEP, and EO. A glossary of these
terms is at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>Note that some SFUSD employees may have access to school-specific,
student-level data files stored in <a
href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DVe6y3D96hBSV-BDHEUD7Zv6ALOjwDyV">Google
Drive folders</a>. If that is of interests to you, please log in with
your SFUSD account to find it out.</p>
<p><img src="1_el_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>Letâ€™s take a closer look at ELAS enrollment at each of the five
cohorts: high schools, middle schools, K-8 schools, elementary schools,
and pre elementary schools (early elementary, pre-K, etc.).</p>
<p><img src="1_el_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>The following five plots provide a closer look at the up-to-date
student enrollment by ELAS at each school. Each plot shows schools in
each of the five cohorts.</p>
<p>Note that in each plot, each bar consists of the proportions of four
ELAS groups within each school. <strong>Also note that the bars are
ordered by the proportion of ELs (which is the first proportion in the
bar) from the highest to the lowest</strong>. Do not rely on the color
theme, hove over a specific proportion of the colored bar to find out
the specific ELAS group and student counts.</p>

<h1>Multilingual Learner Typology (EL Typology)</h1>
<p>EL population is diverse in terms of where they are on the spectrum
toward English language proficiency. EL typology is designed to identify
different subgroups of ELs so that we can provide research-based
multilingual programs and interventions that meet their unique learning
needs.</p>
<p>Please refer to <a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12GjkZb5EjsPEqNjqSC97w08JtjseHqMAqfdzIRYsx1E/edit#slide=id.g288282fe4fd_0_4">this
slide</a> to understand more about how SFUSD identify different
typologies of ELs. Here is a brief glossary of EL Typology categories
being used in this website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newcomer: EL born outside of the US who has been enrolled as an EL
for 3 years or less</li>
<li>NewEL: EL born in the US who has been enrolled as an EL for 3 years
or less</li>
<li>ELOT: EL being enrolled as an EL for 4 or more years, but NOT PTEL
or LTEL</li>
<li>PTEL: EL in grades 3-12 who has been enrolled as an EL for 4-5 years
but has not achieved English proficiency level nor ELA grade-specific
standard in State tests</li>
<li>LTEL: EL being enrolled as an EL for 6 or more years without making
progress</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a breakdown of the proportions of the five EL Typology
groups at SFUSD:</p>
<p><img src="1_el_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="768" /></p>
<p>Certain EL Typologies are more representative than others at a
certain grade level, indicating that multilingual pathway programs and
interventions need to be customized by grade levels to better serve ELsâ€™
learning needs. Looking further into EL Typologies by grade level:</p>
<p><img src="1_el_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>Similar to the previous section, below five plots provide a closer
look at the up-to-date student enrollment by EL Typology at each
school.</p>
<p>Note that for the following three cohorts, high schools, middle
schools, and K-8, <strong>the bars are ordered by the proportion of
LTELs (which is the last proportion in the bar) from the highest to the
lowest</strong>. Do not rely on the color theme, hove over a specific
proportion of the colored bar to find out the specific ELAS group and
student counts.</p>
<p>Note that for the following three cohorts, high schools, middle
schools, and K-8, the bars are ordered by the first proportion - the
proportion of LETLs from the highest to the lowest:</p>
